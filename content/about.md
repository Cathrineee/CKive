I am a 3rd year CS/Data Science student, minor in Combinatorics & Optimization and Psychology, at the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca/). I would like to work in data engineering and machine learning for my future career. I'm about to start my 4-month work term at [Loblaw](http://loblaw.ca) this summer as a Data Engineer.

I had co-op experience as the Software Developer at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, working at the ETL team developing a dashboard for data visualization, and as the ETL Quality Assurance at Teranet, writing data migration scripts as part of the ETL cycle. Earlier in high school, I had multiple internship experiences in the sales and marketing department, working on developing social media content and evaluating websites. I work best in a fast-paced team environment and have a strong academic background in computer science and statistics.

Growing up in China and going through high school in the United States, here I am in a Canadian university, pursuing my journey of adventure. The diverse cultural experience that Iâ€™ve been through opened my eyes to the world and allowed me to embrace different thoughts and ideas. I am passionate and enthusiastic about my life and personally interested in cooking and baking.
